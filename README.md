# Sentiment-Analysis-Book-Reviews-2014
Senior tech project 2013-2014

Sentiment analysis based off of book review data from Goodreads.com.
Most straightforward and short phrases and sentences do okay but more complex sentence structures are iffy...

The most interesting file for idle browsing is probably the dictionary6.txt (or whichever version of the dictionary is the most recent), which contains the weightings assigned to each currently recognized word. The scale ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 being the most positive and 0 being the most negative. Most words are rather neutral (nouns in particular) and weightings may be more accurate with more test data.
